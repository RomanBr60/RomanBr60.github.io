								<P><b>Fiddle</b> is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. the name is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. It became popular in many countries usualy with the influence of the western musican and sometimes replaces many local bowed instruments.<BR/></P>
								<P>There are few real distinctions between violins and fiddles, though more primitively constructed and smaller violins are more likely to be considered fiddles. Due to the style of the music played, fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to allow multiple strings to be played simultaneously with more ease, such as the droning in bluegrass music or performing triple stops.<BR/></P>
								<P>In order to produce a "brighter" tone, compared to the deeper tones of gut or synthetic core strings, fiddlers often prefer to use steel strings on their instruments. Among musical styles, fiddling tends to produce rhythms focused on dancing, with associated quick note changes, whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes. It is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music, but today, many fiddlers have classical training.</P>

								<h3>History</h3>
							</div>
							<div class = "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-left textBody">
							<P>The medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century Europe, deriving from the Byzantine lira (Greek: λύρα, Latin: lira, English: <i>lyre</i>), a bowed string instrument of the Byzantine Empire and ancestor of most European bowed instruments. The first recorded reference to the bowed lira was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lira (lūrā) as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the rabāb played in the Islamic Empires. Lira spread widely westward to Europe; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009).<BR/></P>
							<P>Over the centuries, Europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, became known as the viola da braccio (<I>arm viol</I>) family and evolved into the violin; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, was the viola da gamba (<I>leg viol</I>) group. During the Renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally less aristocratic) <I>viola da braccio family</I>.<BR/></P>

								<h3>Etymology</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-left textBody">
							<P>The etymology of <i>fiddle</i> is uncertain: the Germanic <i>fiddle</i> may derive from the same early Romance word as does <i>violin</i>, or it may be natively Germanic. The name seems however to be related to Icelandic Fiðla and also Old English <i>fiðele</i>. A native Germanic ancestor of <i>fiddle</i> may even be the ancestor of the early Romance form of <i>violin</i>. Historically, <i>fiddle</i> also referred to a predecessor of today's violin. Like the violin, it tended to have four strings, but came in a variety of shapes and sizes. Another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols, which are held between the legs and played vertically, and have fretted fingerboards.<BR/></P>

								<h3>Ensembles</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-left textBody">
							<P>In performance, a solo fiddler, or one fiddler or two with a group of other instrumentalists, is the norm, though twin fiddling is represented in some North American, Scandinavian, Scottish and Irish styles. Violins, on the other hand, are commonly grouped in sections. These contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings: large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments, before electronic amplification, than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in.<BR/></P>
							<P>The difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music. Historically, the majority of fiddle music was dance music, while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely. Violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling, with its dance-driven clear beat, did not always follow. In situations that required greater volume, a fiddler (as long as they kept the beat) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist.<BR/></P>
							<P>Following the folk revivals of the second half of the 20th century, however, it has become common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddlers playing together—see for example the Calgary Fiddlers, and Swedish Spelmanslag folk-musician clubs, and the worldwide phenomenon of Irish sessions.<BR></P>

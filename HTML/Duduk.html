								<P>The <b>duduk</b><i>(doo-dook)</i> an ancient double-reed woodwind flute made of apricot wood. It is indigenous to Armenia. It is commonly played in pairs: while the first player plays the song, the second plays a steady drone, and the sound of the two instruments together creates a richer, more haunting sound.<br/></P>
								<P>The unflattened reed and cylindrical body produce a sound closer to the English horn than to more commonly known double-reeds. Unlike other double reed instruments like the oboe or shawm, the duduk has a very large reed proportional to its size. UNESCO proclaimed the Armenian duduk and its music as a Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005 and inscribed it in 2008. Duduk music has been used in a number of films, most notably in The Russia House and Gladiator.<br/></P>
								<p>Variations of the duduk exist in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, including the balaban in Azerbaijan and Iran.<br/></p>

								<h3>Etymology</h3>
							</div>
							<div class = "col-lg-10 col-sm-10 col-xs-10 text-left textBody">
							<P>The word "duduk" (Armenian: դուդուկ) is derived from Turkish "düdük"which means whistle. The word dudka in Slavic languages is a diminutive of duda and is of native Proto-Slavic origin.
							</P>
							<P>This instrument is not to be confused with the northwestern Bulgarian folk instrument of the same name (see below, Balkan duduk).<BR/></P>

								<h3>Overview</h3>
							</div>
							<div class = "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-left textBody">
							<P>The duduk is a double reed instrument with ancient origins, having existed since at least the fifth century, while there are Armenian scholars who believe it existed more than 1,500 years before that. The earliest instruments similar to the duduk's present form are made of bone or entirely of cane. Today, the duduk is exclusively made of wood with a large double reed, with the body made from aged apricot wood.<BR/></P>
							<P>The particular tuning depends heavily on the region in which it is played. In the twentieth century, the Armenian duduk began to be standardized diatonic in scale and single-octave in range. Accidentals, or chromatics are achieved using fingering techniques. The instrument's body also has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region. The reed (Armenian: եղեգն, <i>eġegn</i>), is made from one or two pieces of cane in a duck-bill type assembly. Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breath requirements. The duduk player is called <i>dudukahar</i> (դուդուկահար) in Armenian.</BR></P>
							<P>The performer uses air stored in his cheeks to keep playing the instrument while he inhales air into his lungs. This "circular" breathing technique is commonly used with all the double-reed instruments in the Middle East.<BR/></P>
							<P>Duduk "is invariably played with the accompaniment of a second <i>dum duduk</i>, which gives the music an energy and tonic atmosphere, changing the scale harmoniously with the principal duduk."<BR/></P>

								<h3>History</h3>

							<div class = "col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-left textBody">
							<P>Armenian musicologists cite evidence of the duduk's use as early as 1200 BC, though Western scholars suggest it is 1,500 years old. Variants of the duduk can be found in Armenia and the Caucasus. The history of the Armenian duduk music is dated to the reign of the Armenian king Tigran the Great, who reigned from 95–55 B.C. According to ethnomusicologist Dr. Jonathan McCollum, the instrument is depicted in numerous Armenian manuscripts of the Middle Ages, and is "actually the only truly Armenian instrument that's survived through history, and as such is a symbol of Armenian national identity ... The most important quality of the duduk is its ability to express the language dialectic and mood of the Armenian language, which is often the most challenging quality to a duduk player."</BR></P>

							<P>While "duduk" most commonly refers to the double reed instrument described on this page, by coincidence there is a different instrument of the same name played in northwestern Bulgaria. This is a blocked-end flute resembling the Serbian frula, known also as kaval or kavalče in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and as duduk (дудук) in northwest Bulgaria. Made of maple or other wood, it comes in two sizes: 700–780 millimetres (28–31 in) and 240–400 millimetres (9.4–15.7 in) (duduce). The blocked end is flat. Playing this type of duduk is fairly straightforward and easy, and its sound is clean and pleasant.<BR/></P>

							<P> The sound of the duduk has become known to wider audiences through its use in popular film soundtracks. Starting with Peter Gabriel's score for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, the duduk's archaic and mournful sound has been employed in a variety of genres to depict such moods. Djivan Gasparyan played the duduk in Gladiator, Syriana, and Blood Diamond, among others. The duduk was also used extensively in Battlestar Galactica. The duduk was also used in the series Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its computer-altered sound was given to the fictitious Tsungi horn, played by a number of the characters. The sound of the duduk was used in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A Lullaby that Mr. Tumnus plays on a fictitious double flute. Duduk is used in the theme song of the Dothraki clan in TV adaptation of Game of Thrones<BR/></P>
							<P>The 2010 Eurovision Song Contest entry from Armenia "Apricot Stone", which finished 7th in the final, featured prominent duduk played by Djivan Gasparyan. In the indie-rock genre, the French-American band Deleyaman is the first alternative music band to have featured the duduk on all of their albums with Gerard Madilian as a permanent member in their line-up.<BR/></P>
